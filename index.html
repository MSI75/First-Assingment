            <h3>My Recipes</h3>
            <p>
                This is a meal that people eat at lunchtime, around noon.The
                vegetarian-friendly chowder pairs perfectly with a vibrant green salad
                or a thick slice of crusty bread. It is loaded with a handful of
                vegetables to give you a wonderfully chunky bite with each spoonful.
                The smoked paprika adds a subtle smokiness that enhances the kick from
                the jalapeño and cayenne peppers.
